Hello, and welcome to my WIP Warhammer Sccoring App.

MVP: 
The app should allow the user to create, edit, & remove players.
The user should be able to create new games
There should be a way to display all the games for a player, and all the players in a game.
The app should display if a game was won or lost

Extension: 
Given a field of 8 players, the app should be able to gereate 4 games at random, 
then given the results of those 4 games should be able to generate the next round of games
using the Swiss pairings system.
